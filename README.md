# Kanayo-Sportybet-Scrapper
I wrote a Python Scraper ( I called it Kanayo SportyGrab) that uses FastAPI to run via sportybet &amp; select odds above 1k &amp; mostly of basketball. The inspiration came from @JeffreyConnect twitter post. The Scraper uses FastAPI , Beautiful Soup in the hood and TailwindCSS
